Chat Me : it is a PHP Project devloped by Omi, Rishi, Aditya {035,037,038} which is just like a Whats App application

to run this Project make a DataBase with Name : "chatme"
and import chatme.sql file

after you need to paste this folder in "C:\xampp\htdocs" path

after you can run "http://localhost/chatme/" then you can sign up and sign in.

after that you will redirect to the home.php page wich is main page and where you can chat with your friends but there will be no friends in starting

you need to add friends for that you again need to create another account 

log out can be done by clicking on our profile {first image on top-left cornner}

after making few account you can make friends and using blue arrow you can open chat section 

then you can easly chat with your friends using that textarea and green sending button
